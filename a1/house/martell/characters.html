			<h4>Biography</h4>
			<p>Prince Oberyn, known as the <em>Red Viper of Dorne</em>, is the younger brother of Doran Martell, the Prince of Dorne, and the late Elia Martell, wife of Rhaegar Targaryen, the late Prince of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne. Traveling to King's Landing to attend Joffrey's royal wedding in his brother's place, Oberyn's real motive is to seek revenge for the murder and rape of his sister by Tywin's bannerman, Gregor Clegane. Oberyn gets an opportunity to kill Clegane when he volunteers to champion Tyrion Lannister in a trial by combat; although he manages to severely wound and poison Clegane, he is ultimately killed.<br/>
			Prince Oberyn is the younger brother of Prince Doran Martell and Princess Elia Martell; like most members of House Martell, he is styled "Prince" instead of "Lord". He is nicknamed "the Red Viper" for his knowledge of poisons and for his unusual, deadly style of combat. Oberyn is known for being an accomplished warrior, but Tyrion implies that he is just as infamous for his sexual appetite. Oberyn's paramour is Ellaria Sand; she is his wife in all but name, and is the mother of the five of Oberyn's infamous eight bastard daughters, all of whom he has acknowledged and given his love and care. He named the fifth one, Elia Sand, after his late sister.<br/>
			When he was a teenager, Oberyn was accompianed by his little sister Elia on a visit to Casterly Rock. While there, Oberyn and Elia were eager to see the "monster" that had just been born. Cersei finally showed them Tyrion, but the Martell siblings were somewhat disappointed to see that he was just a baby, and somewhat disturbed by Cersei's already strong hatred of him.

			<h4>Biography</h4>
			<p>Doran Martell is the Prince of Dorne and the Lord of Sunspear. He is the head of House Martell, the ruling house of Dorne. He is the older brother of the late Princess Elia, who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane in the Sack of King's Landing, and Prince Oberyn, known as The Red Viper, also killed by Clegane.<br/>
			He suffers from a severe case of gout, which prevents him from walking and restricts him to a wheelchair.<br/>
			Unlike his more hotheaded and aggressive brother, Oberyn, Doran is a pensive, calculating and patient man who always waits and observes before making his next move. Despite their different personalities, the two brothers are very close.
