		<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> is an American fantasy drama television series created for HBO by showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, <em>George R. R. Martin's</em> series of fantasy novels, the first of which is titled A Game of Thrones. Filmed in a Belfast studio and on location elsewhere in Northern Ireland, Croatia, Iceland, Morocco, Spain, Malta, Scotland, and the United States, it premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011. Two days after the fourth season premiered in April 2014, HBO renewed Game of Thrones for a fifth and sixth season. The fifth season premiered on April 12, 2015<br/>
		The series, set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos at the end of a decade-long summer, interweaves several plot lines with a broad ensemble cast. The first narrative arc follows a civil war among several noble houses for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms; the second covers the attempts of the exiled last scion of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty to reclaim the throne; the third chronicles the rising threat of the impending winter and the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North.

		<h2>Houses</h2>
		<p>The Great Houses are the most powerful of the noble houses of the Seven Kingdoms. They exercise immense authority and power over their vassals and territories and are answerable only to the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, King of the Andals and the First Men.<br/>
		Before the <em>Targaryen</em> Conquest, each of the Seven Kingdoms was ruled independently by a powerful royal family. During the Conquest these families were either destroyed and replaced, or defeated and forced to swear allegiance to King Aegon, reigning from the Iron Throne in King's Landing.<br/>
		The Gardeners, Hoares, and Durrendons were slain and replaced by the <em>Tyrells</em>, Greyjoys, and <em>Baratheons</em> respectively, while the <em>Lannisters</em>, Arryns, and <em>Starks</em> surrendered peacefully and were allowed to remain in control of their lands. In addition, Aegon raised up the Tullys to rule over the Riverlands, which had been under ironborn occupation prior to his arrival. Only House <em>Martell</em> of Dorne resisted his armies, but was later brought into the fold through a peaceful marriage-alliance some two centuries later.<br/>
		Each Great House has a large number of vassal houses serving it, most of whom in turn have smaller vassals under them, extending all the way down to farmers and landed knights. Each Great House rules over its territory and is responsible for collecting taxes and, in times of war, raising troops to fight for the king. Otherwise they are largely left to operate autonomously to simplify the bureaucracy and governance of the realm.<br/>
		Robert's Rebellion ended in the exile of the last Targaryens, with House Baratheon replacing them on the Iron Throne.<br/>
		The War of the Five Kings has seen changes amongst the Great Houses. House Baratheon is divided into House Baratheon of King's Landing and House Baratheon of Dragonstone, both claiming the Iron Throne, while the defeat of the Starks and the Tullys has led to them to be replaced by former vassal houses Bolton and Frey, respectively.
